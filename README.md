# Woodworking Projects Showcase

This is a React-based web application that showcases various woodworking projects. The app features a photo gallery where each project is represented with a photo, title, and description. Users can click on any project to view more details in a modal that displays the photo, title, and a brief description of the project.

## Features

- Responsive photo gallery layout with 3 items per row, adjusting to 2 items on tablets and 1 on mobile.
- Clean and minimal design with a focus on presenting woodworking projects.
- Clicking on any project opens a modal with a larger view of the project photo, title, and description.
- Header titled **"Woodworking Projects"** that clearly separates the title from the gallery.
- Smooth hover effects and modals with a subtle box shadow and darkened background for focus.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the gallery, header, and modal components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript used throughout the app.
